Does God exist?\",\"id\":1,\"value\":\"We may get two contradictory answers as 'Yes!' or 'No!' to the question, 'Does God exist?' Our intellect easily accepts that there could be Someone Who created everything visible and invisible. It apprehends the Creator through the creatures.Is there a Power which exists by Itself?Those who deny the existence of God generally say that everything in nature have come to exist by themselves. If it were true, won't they also have a power of living by themselves? If they have such a power, why do they not survive eternally using this power, but arrive at a non-existent state at a particular time? From this, one who has the power of understanding can understand that to say that the nature has the ability to come into existence by itself is utterly contrary to truth.\\n\\n\\nAn Engineer is absolutely necessary for building a structure!Only when the intellectual man think well, plan well and then act well before doing anything in this world, it will come good.How does the movement of the lifeless things occur?Therefore even if the lifeless sun, the moon, the earth and other planets which are powerless to exist by themselves, or to think or to plan, travel in a pre-determined direction, at an exact speed and at an unchangeable distance from one another, do they move as such, planning by themselves? Or if we ask ourselves whether there is Someone Who directs all these heavenly bodies, then we can understand that there is a God Who is the greatest Engineer, Who makes them travel according to many mathematical rules.Even if the distance between the Earth and the Sun decrease by a few thousand miles, the land part of the Earth will submerge into the sea and emerge out again twice a day. Everything in the places where it would be daytime will be reduced to ashes as being burnt by the enormous heat produced by the sun. And everything will freeze in the frost where there is night time. There must be Someone Who calculated all these and created them accordingly. 'Every house is built by some man; but He Who created all things, is God' (Hebr. 3:4).The plants which do what the scientists cannot do!Even if all the scientists of the world join together, can they change water into cane-juice or palm-water or wine? They can't. But an indiscriminate sugarcane plant which cannot make plans, change water it gets into cane-juice; the palmira tree changes water into palm-water, a wine plant converts water into wine. If this is possible for them, do they act by themselves? Never! If they could do so, then a palm tree could have given milk instead, by itself!The One Who exists, make things exist.The One Who exists, being the source of wisdom, power and goodness and surpassing everything including yesterday, today and tomorrow, and being worthy to be called as 'One Who Exists,' have had these plants act so (Exxodus 3:14; John 8:24)! He has given necessary power to them for what they do, and have let them exist until a time fixed by Himself. It is the mason who built his own house!\\n\\nWho fixed the natural law?A motor works according to its design drawn by its maker. And we call the way it works as natural, don't we? As it works so, can anyone say that it does so by itself making all its components with its own power? Can he say that there could be no one who made it? If he says so, wouldn't it be against truth? As such, is it not conceivable that it is contrary to say that there is no God Who created everything in nature?There has been no one who proved that there is no God. But there had been so many who saw God, who spoke to Him, such as Adam, Eve, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and so on. There are so many historical evidences for their existence on earth.Could man have evolved from a monkey?Is it possible for those who say so, to prove when, in which year and where the first man came into being and who the first man was? Can he say where that man showed up, in Europe or in Africa? Whether he was short, or tall, or whether he began to live 5 million years ago or 10 million years ago? Even the scientists have so many ideas full of confusions regarding this. (See Dinamani 1-8-84; Dinamalar 7-8-91). The name of the first man, according to the Bible,Adam means one who came from the slime of the earth. And God Himself says that he was dust (Gen. 3:19). The body of man accepts food that comes from the earth and the earth accepts his body when he dies. That man was created from dust becomes apparent from the fact that his body turns into dust after death. Can anyone prove how a monkey provided man with the intellect which it does not possess for itself? No way!Is it right to demand, 'Bring God before our eyes?'The eyes which are not capable of seeing the micro organisms which have life and a structure, and which are in the air around us, are not worthy to even desire to have the power to behold the omnipotent God, Who Himself is Light. As one needs a microscope to see a germ, so he needs a pure heart to see God, the Source of purity. 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God' (Matt.5:8). So let us live, firmly believing the truth that there is a God Who is omnipotent and Who created and rules everything according to His own will!\"},{\"question\":\"2. Is the Christ God?\",\"id\":2,\"value\":\"We are sure that questions such as, who is God, how\\n\\n\\nmany Persons is He, is the Christ God, Is He equal to the Father, etc. would rise anyway. Let us have a goodwill to get the right answers to these questions.Were there religions and gods which disappeared in time?So many religions name many as gods. It is not possible to see today many religions and gods which existed in the world long ago. They have entirely disappeared. Even many Protestant sects which were established in the 16th century A.D. also have disappeared.Is God not the only One Who is pre-eminent to everything?A God must be the One who have surpassed all the times, all the powers and all the created wisdom. This is why we call Him as pre-eminent to everything. Though men praise those who do not have these attributes as gods, they will be forgotten as time advances; that is, he will have gradually faded away from the minds of men.What is God in His substance and personality?It will be understood that 'God is a pure Spirit' (John 4:24), when one looks in the right way. 'God created him(Adam) in His own image' (Gen. 1:27). From these, we understand that the human soul was created after the image of God. 'The Lord appeared to Abraham in the valley of Mambre... and when he (Abraham) lifted his eyes up, there appeared to him three men standing near him' (Gen. 18:1,2). From this we come to realize that the divine Persons could take the form of a man whenever they deem it is necessary. From the commandment of Jesus Christ, 'Baptize them in the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost' (Matt. 28:29), we grasp the truth that there are three Persons in one God and they are pure Spirits. To distinguish between Them, They have names as the Father, the Son, Who was called Jesus Christ the Emmanuel, when He came into the world, and the Holy Ghost, the third Person. The Father is a Spirit, so is the Son (before He became Man to save mankind from hell) and the Holy Ghost.How is it that there is only one God?As these three Persons are equal in wisdom, power, will and the divine nature, without any difference whatsoever, we call them as one God.With the help of the little flame of a first candle (say, the Father), you lit a second candle (say, the Son). Then with with these two candles, you lit a third candle (say, the Holy Ghost.). Now, can you find any difference between the burning power, heat, and light of these three candles? You can't, can you? As these are three different forms of\\n\\nthe flame of the first candle, so the three persons, the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost are three distinguished forms of the one and same God. One is the Truth! God, the Source of Truth is also One!Is it true to say that God and the Lord are the same?The Father is the Lord, so are the Son and the Holy Ghost. We can see so many verses in the Bible such as, '...To your Lord thy God,' (Deut. 6:5, Matt. 22:37),'Do not tempt the Lord your God,' (Deut. 6:16, Matt. 4:7), 'the Lord your God' etc. 'The Lord (the Father) said to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand, until I make Your enemies Your footstool' (Ps. 109:1, Matt. 22:43,44). 'The Lord is the Spirit' (2 Cor. 3:17,18). Therefore all the three Persons are the Lord.What is the emptied state of Christ?Using some of the words of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Who although being in the form of God, emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave for the sake of our salvation (Phil.2:6,7), some people argue that only the Father is God, the Almighty. Generally Jesus and the Holy Ghost are called as the Lord, They are also God like the Father. St. Peter told Ananias, 'Why have Satan tempted your heart, that you should lie to the Holy Ghost...? (Acts 5:3) You have not lied to men,but to God' (Acts. 5:5). St. Thomas said to Our Lord, 'My Lord, my God!' (John 20:28). Our Lord Jesus also accepted it. Jesus, the Word of God was God with God in the beginning. Everything was created through Him (John 1:1-3). He said, 'I and the Father are one' (John 10:30; 17:11,12). He also claimed that 'All things whatsoever the Father has, are Mine' (John 16:15, 17:20).What is the pre-eminence of the Christ like?'He Who comes from above, is above everyone' (John 3:31). 'He (Jesus) is over all things, God, blessed for ever' (Rom. 9:5; John 3:31). From these verses, it is clearly established that Christ is the Omnipotent and ' True God' (1 John 5:20). 'A Child is born for us... He is...God the Almighty...' (Isai. 9:6). From this, it is clearly conceivable that the other two Persons of the Holy Trinity are one and the same with God the Father.Can Christ be accused?Some people would charge Jesus Christ with some accusations, thus speaking ill of Him. Is there any possibility for them to know what even those who were contemporaneous with Jesus and knew Him well did not know about Him?Jesus Christ threw the gauntlet saying, 'Who among\\n\\n\\nyou can accuse Me to be with sin?' (John 8:46). And even at that time, there was nobody to take it up. And today also nobody is found to be spotless and deserved to accept this challenge!Is Christ only a Man? What is the divine power of Christ??Let those who are obstinate in saying that Christ is only a Man, think something! Even if all the scientists in this world come together, they cannot still the storm and the sea with one word, nor give eyesight to the blind and to raise the dead to life. This is the divine power, far beyond the power of man. This is the power of God, which no founder of any religion except Jesus Christ had. From this, it is well understood that Christ is the true God and the religion which He established is the true religion of salvation. It has not been said throughout the Bible that the Father is the only omnipotent God. On the contrary, the Jehovah witnesses resist the divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, saying that He is not God Almighty, but only a Man. Realize well that this is not at all true!\"},{\"question\":\"3. Which is the Church (Religion) founded by Christ to guide men to salvation?\",\"id\":3,\"value\":\"Who is the head of the Church, after Christ? What are his powers?Jesus said to St. Peter: 'Simon, son of Jona, you are blessed, because flesh and blood have not revealed it to you, but My Father Who is in heaven. And I say to you: That you are Peter; and upon this rock, I will build My Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever you will bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven; and whatsoever you will loose on earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven' (Matt. 16: 17-19).'Simon, son of John... Feed My lambs... Feed my sheep' (John 21:15-17).'Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith does not fail, and you, being once converted, confirm your brethren' (Luke 22;31,32).\\n\\n\\nWhich is the Church of the redeemed?'And the Lord brought together the redeemed with them' (Acts. 2:47).'In the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed.' (Daniel 2:44,45; 7:23-27) This rock refers nothing but this kingdom.Which was the Church which Lord Jesus established when He was in the world?When Our Lord Jesus Christ lived in this world, He established His Church and entrusted it to the care of St. Peter, son of John and his successors, providing him with the power of binding and loosing, feeding His lambs and sheep and guiding His flock to the Kingdom of God. Can anyone prove that God did the same with somebody else also, giving all the powers He endowed upon Peter?While Our Lord Jesus Christ founded only one Church, and has brought together those who were to be redeemed into this Church till date, is it right for men to establish other 'churches' as per their own will? Is there any possibility that there could be salvation in them?Was the prophesy that the Church would be established in Rome, fulfilled?The Church established upon St. Peter, the rock, is the Kingdom of God upon earth (Col. 1:13). This Kingdom conquered the Roman kingdom itself which, through the Roman proconsul Pontius Pilate (Luke 3:1, Matt. 27:2) killed Jesus Christ, our Savior. As the fulfillment of the prophesy, 'In the days of those kingdoms, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed' (Daniel 2:44,45; 7:23-27), this Church was established by St. Peter as the redeeming Church of Christ in Rome (See 'The History of the Church.') Is there any other 'church' which has achieved this? This (Catholic) Church, according to the Milan Treaty, became the Religion of the Roman kingdom and began to extend its saving power from there upon the rest of the world.Is it acceptable to say that the many schismatic sects which were born yesterday and exist today were established by Christ Himself?Is it not right to say that the Church never failed?After God Himself has promised to His Church by saying, 'Behold, I am with you all days' (Matt.28:20), and 'When the Spirit of Truth comes, He will lead you to all truth' (John16:13), will it not be blasphemous to say that the Church failed, as if God has abandoned it against His own\\nbe punished for being in the sects made by men?So, let them figure out a way to escape damnation in the end for being in the sects made by men in the latter times, having the Bible and uttering the Lord's Name in vain! And may they understand that nobody could enter the Eternal Kingdom without doing the holy will of the Lord (Matt. 7:21).Is it the divine will for men to be in the sects made by men?While Our Lord Jesus Christ has established only one Church for the sake of our redemption (Matt. 16:18), can it be the divine will that humans should establish other churches? Is it the divine will for us to depend upon those churches? Enter into the only Church founded by the Lord and be redeemed! May the grace of God and His blessing enable you!\"},{\"question\":\"4. Can we accept the Bible?\",\"id\":4,\"value\":\"We can see nowhere in the Bible that God ever gave any cut and dried command to form a written Bible. Nevertheless, do those who have the Bible in their hand and question the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, have theword?Did the Lord Jesus found a Church so that it should fail, or, to be destroyed?'This house is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of Truth' (1 Tim. 3;15).According to the words of Jesus, Our Lord, 'Go, teach all nations, making them My disciples' (Matt.28:19), it has been the Roman Catholic Church which made all nations His disciples, and brought about one Head and one Liturgy of Faith and which has been existing since the time of Apostles! 'That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity' (2 Thess. 2:12).Will he who despise the Church be punished?'If he will not hear the Church, let him be a heathen and a publican to you' (Matt. 18:17).'He who despises you, despises Me, and he who desipises Me, despises Him who sent Me' (Luke 10:16).'They (the Angels) will gather out of His Kingdom all scandals, and those who work iniquity and will cast them into the furnace of fire; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth' (Matt. 13:41).Must not one figure out a way in order not to\\n\\n\\nguts to ask with what authority the Roman Catholic Church codefied the Bible? Or will they dare to reject the Bible codefied by the Catholic Church?How was the Bible formed?Through the words of Our Lord Jesus Christ, 'Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, that your faith does not fail, and you, being once converted, confirm your brethren' (Luke 22;31), and again, 'Feed My lambs, feed My sheep'(John 21:15,17), St. Peter received from Him, the power to bind and loose, the keys of heaven (Matt. 16:19) and the infallibility (Luke 22:31). The Pope, as the successor of St. Peter, using the same power received by him, codefied the Holy Book of Christianity under the name, 'The Bible' according to the instructions of the Carthage Council given in 397 AD, (To know about the first Council, see Acts: 15:1-29.) as 'the holy Scripture can instruct you to salvation, by the faith in Jesus Christ' (2 Tim. 3:15). This he did so that he could lead the sheep to everlasting life. The Holy Scriptures is the property of the Roman Catholic Church. And nobody whosoever has no right whatsoever to add or remove anything from this Catholic Bible.Which are the primitive religion and the primitive holy book?The Christianity did not come into existence in the latter times, as some say. Similarly, the Old Testament of the Bible was also not of the recent times. The connection between God and man since the creation of the world and the promises of God have been established already in the primitive days of mankind. The Christianity is the most primitive religion of the world. Only the names are different. As the history of the world is divided into BC and AD, the Bible is divided into the Old and New Testaments and the religion of God, into Before Christianity, and Post Christianity. But the basic faith is the same; the religion is also the same. Christ has been there before Abraham was created (John 8:58). He is in heaven as the Second Person of God. Therefore His religion also exists from the beginning. How?The sunlight which we see at dawn on the eastern horizon, after it has risen and after the sun sets on the western horizon is the same sunlight. Similarly, those who have faith in Him before and after He became a Man visible to our eyes are of the same religion. In the same way, as it was promised (Gen. 3:15; 12:3; Num. 24:17; Mich. 5:2) that the Christ, Who is God and the Light of the world (John 8:12) would come to the world as its Redeemer (Matt. 11:3), those who lived along the path shown by God expecting the first advent of Christ were also His own people. And those who\\n\\n\\nlive after His first advent, following His commandments and expecting His second coming (Matt. 25:31; Acts. 1:11; 2 Tim. 2:1) also belong to Him. Therefore Christianity is the most primitive religion and the Bible is the most primitive holy Book!What is the genuineness of the Bible?The question may arise whether the Bible which comprises of the fundamental Truths of Christianity is genuine and reliable. Among all the holy books, it is the Bible only which speaks of the creation of mankind, and the history of its spreading all over the world distinctly. It has prophesied the things of the future clearly, and has been a testimony to what have happened, thus having a historical foundation.Is it right to say the Bible is not only spiritual, but also historic?Jesus mentioned all about the creation of the world and the prophesies about the Savior and said: 'If you believe Moses, you will also believe Me, for He wrote about none but Me' (John 5:46). The Bible, the Israelites and their history bear the indisputable testimony to the fact that everything written as a prophesy such as the tribe in which He would be born, (of Juda, Gen. 49:8-10), the place of His birth (Bethlehem - Mich. 5:2), the time (Seven weeks after the command to rebuild Jerusalem - Daniel 9:25), from what kind of a mother (a Virgin - Isai. 7:14), His way of life(Isai. 61:1-3), His way of death (Dan. 9:26; Isai. 52:13-15; 53:1-12; Ps. 21:7-19; 68:22), His resurrection (Ps. 16:8-11; 132:11; 109:1) etc. have all been fulfilled to the letter. It is also a genuine historical book providing the geneology of Christ from Adam.Are there any facts which bear testimony to the fulfillment of the prophesies in the Bible?Jesus came to bear testimony to the Truth. 'I am the way, the truth and the life' He said (John 14:6). And He created history even before His birth, by fulfilling what He had said through the prophets, such as being betrayed by His disciple Judas (John 13;21), His crucifixion and death, His resurrection (Matt. 20:17-19). From this, anyone can realize that the Bible is a genuine and reliable Book.What are the infallibility and the way of writing of the Bible?'Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall not pass, of the law, till all be fulfilled' (Matt. 5:18). 'Scripture can not pass away' (John 10:35); 'All Scripture, inspired by God, is profitable to teach, to reprove to correct and to instruct in justice' (2 Tim. 3:16). 'No prophecy is made by private interpretation, for prophecy did not come by the will of man at any time. but the holy men of God spoke,\\n\\n\\ninspired by the Holy Ghost' (2 Pet. 1:20,21). The Ten Commandments were written by the Hand of God (Exod. 32:16). 'God's word is living and effectual' (Heb. 4;12).From these, we come to know how the Bible which contains the words of Truth which cannot pass, was written and how reliable it is. 'And if any man will take away anything from this book of prophecy, God will take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city, the heaven' (Apoc. 22:19). Moreover, it is also conceivable that one should bear in mind the fact that to interpret the word of God as one wishes, contrary to the interpretation of the head appointed by God to guide His own people is absolutely wrong.What is the way of explaining the words of God?Even St. Paul went to visit St. Peter to be enlightened in the case of circumcision (Acts. 15:2). As he said, 'I went up according to the revelation, lest perhaps I should run, or had run in vain' (Gal. 2:2), it is the will of God for us to be obedient to the leadership established by Christ. Instead, those who interpret the Scriptural words according to their own desires, and who, having itching ears, heap to themselves preachers (2 Tim. 4:3) will be punished with hell (Matt.13:37-41).What are the scientific arguments against the Bible?Besides, those who argue scientifically against the Bible, can never prove the words of Christ as false, nor can they testify that He was a liar. Those who oppose them must first realize that science could never grow enough to understand and explain the divine inspired words of the Bible, on the creation of the world, for instance. We must never have only what we see or listen as the standard for measurement. There are invisible rays; there are imperceptible sounds too. As history proves, the scientific 'truths' generally change day by day.Science has not become perfect: the statement of a scientist.'Science too has its own boundaries. It is absurd to think that it is all powerful. I am one of those who invented the mechanical brain. I have been living in the world of science for the last 50 years. When looking through the eyes of my experience, what I discern is that science has its own limitations.Many new inventions emerging from the laboratories of the scientists may be good to a small extent. However, science has never proven anything to perfection. Ev\\n\\n\\nerything is novel and perfect until another is invented. Nowadays nobody accepts that the inventions of Eucnid or Keiler are perfect' - so declares the famous scientist Venny Warbush (See Dinamalar 27-12-70). Newton's theories of gravitational wave and relativity differ from those of Einstein. But the Bible stands erect and still beyond time and science. Therefore may our principle be, 'Knowledge of the Scripture is the perfect knowledge.'has said, 'Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God' (John 3:5), it is absolutely necessary to one and all to receive baptism.Is submersive Baptism necessary?It is nowhere said in the Holy Scriptures that such a baptism is necessary. Moreover, we have no historical evidence for such a custom to be prevailing in the early Church. The eight souls in the period of Noe (1 Pet. 3:21) were not dipped in the Baptism of the Red sea! (1 Cor. 10:2).When St. John spoke about the baptism which he was administering, he didn't say that it absolved sins. On the contrary, he said, 'I indeed baptize you in water unto penance. but He Who will come after me, is mightier than me, Whose shoes I am not worthy to untie; He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire' (Matt. 3:11). Jesus Christ, Who is God was never in sin. But, through the episode of His baptism, the Baptism bore testimony to the greater Baptism of Christ Himself, and commanded the people to receive that Baptism of absolution of sins. Similarly, to show that John's baptism was not at all necessary, St. Paul baptized once again those who had already received that baptism, in the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ (See Acts. 19:3-5). And, do you have to submerge yourself in a river, or a pond to 'take bath?' Will you not be said to have taken bath if you do it in your bath\"},{\"question\":\"5. What is Baptism?\",\"id\":5,\"value\":\"Various kinds of ideas about when and how Baptism should be received reach our ears. It is extremely necessary to find what is true in this regard.Why must we be baptized?'I was conceived in iniquities; and my mother conceived me in sin' (Ps. 50:5). 'As by one man sin entered into this world and by sin, death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned... (Rom. 5:12). Just as the children have their share in their patrimony, so do we have our share in the sin of our first parents. Baptism is a sacrament which enables us to be cleansed through a sacred birth and lets us partake in the Kingdom of God. Since our Lord\\n9:18), the thief on the right side (Luke 23:43), the keeper of the prison and all his family (Acts. 16:33) go to the river as a herd of cows? Is it written in the Bible that they received a submersive baptism with the gift of tongues? No! Even St. Paul did not speak multiple languages! Didn't all these people receive baptism? Therefore it is understood that there is no connection between the gift of tongues and Baptism.Moreover the sin is in the soul. The Baptismal water touches the body. From this, let us realize that cleaning the body with the Baptismal water, is but a sign of cleansing the stain of sin from the soul (1 Pet. 3:21). Head is what governs the body. Moreover, as our first parents bowed their heads as a consent to pluck the fruit of sin, and Our Lord, Who repaired that sin, gave His life bowing His Head to the Will of God (John 19:30), it is enough for us to bow our head, consenting and accepting the Savior, and receive baptism, by being poured with Baptismal water, in order to be absolved from our original sin. And this baptism, is, in itself, capable of crushing the head of Satan (Gen. 3:15).Can the infants be baptized?If it is atrocious that thousands of unborn babies are aborted everyday all over the world, it would be more atrocious to hinder them from receiving Baptism, thus letting them be ruined, dying with original sin. Is it not a greater folly toroom, pouring water on you from a tub or a bucket, or if you use a shower? Be baptized in Christ than inside water! (Gal 3:27).Can you be baptized, exactly as the Lord received it?I ask those who argue, saying that people were dipped into water for receiving baptism in the days of the Old testament, and since even Jesus also received such a baptism, we must also receive it exactly in the same way: Are you ready to wait for 30 years like Him, and then go on foot to the banks of Jordan, revive the Baptist back to life and say to him 'We will not receive the Baptism which Christ bestows on the catechumens through His priests. Even though this is a cursed land, though this water has been contaminated, you must give us the submersive baptism,' and receive the same baptism of Christ from him?Our Lord asked the sons of Zebedee, ' Can you be baptized with the baptism with which I would be baptized?' (Mark 10:39). Do you know which baptism He speaks about? (Luke 12:50).Is Baptism with gift of tongues right?Did those 3000 people and the 5000 people (Acts.2;41; 4:4), Paul who was not in a position to walk (Acts.\\n\\n\\ncaused by the dominant devil?Do the children too have a call for Baptism?Has it been said anywhere in the Bible that children should not be baptized? Can it be denied with proof that the call for Baptism was never given to children?'Repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is to you and to your children... whom the Lord our God will call' (Acts. 2:39). Children also have the call (Matt. 19:14). In order to repent and be baptized, a child has never turned towards any actual sin! So it need not repent.Had the children never been baptized in the first centuries?'He and all his house was baptized immediately' (Acts. 16:33); 'When she and her household were baptized...(Acts 16:15): in these words, the house or the household includes the children also. They are also part of the house. Those who were `baptized' with Moses in the Red Sea (Exodus 13:21; 1 Cor. 10:2) also included children.Do you ask your children before giving them a Christian name or teach them prayers? You take them to the church according to your own faith! If someone say that it isimpede the act of removing the Sin which seperates infants from God, thus forbidding them to come to Our Lord Jesus Christ Who said, 'Do not forbid the little children not to come to Me, for the Kingdom of heaven is for such' (Matt. 19:14)? Even after He said, 'It is not the will of your Father, Who is in heaven, that none of these little ones should perish' (Matt. 18:14), are those wise people who do not understand the simple fact that the sin which came through others (that is, through the parents) could be removed on behalf of others (that is, on behalf of the faith of the parents, elders etc.)? Is it not peculiar, that these unwise people who support the evil spirit by compelling the children to be in the state of sin, say that they have received the Holy Spirit?Can't the infants be baptized on behalf of others?Did not Our Lord bless the children who did not know what the blessing of Our Lord meant, on behalf of the parents who brought them with faith (Mark 10:16)? Did He give them a useless blessing? Didn't He cleanse the soul of John the Baptist from Sin through His Mother (Luke 1:44)?Is it not ridiculous to say that God, Who helped the centurion's servant through the faithful call of the centurion (Matt.8:5-13), and the children through people such as the Canaanite woman (Matt.15:28), would not take away the sin\\n\\nnot of any use to do anything according to your faith, won't you do so?Finally, as 'He who has washed, needs not but to wash his feet' (John 13:10), it must be enough for a person who has consented to Jesus, the Fruit of the womb of Salvation (Luke 1:42), to wash his head only with faith, in order to receive Baptism, so that the sin born of the consent of the first parents to pluck the fruit of sin, be taken away. The submersive baptism is not at all necessary! As it is written that 'diverse washings... will be there only until the time of correction (Heb. 9:10), it is right that they disappeared later!How many kinds of sin are there? How many kinds of punishments are there?'All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin which does not bring about the final death' (1 John 5:17);'For every idle word that men shall speak, they will render an account for it in the day of judgment' (Matt. 12:36).In the human courts of law also, homicide and adultery are looked upon as greater crimes and death sentence or life imprisonment is given to these greater crimes. Quarrels, etc. are considered as smaller ones, and the culprits of this kind are released after a few days of detention.Similarly, as we generally say that someone who suffering a lot, dies without dying, those who die with greater sins are punished by God with the eternal damnation, which is the biggest suffering. It is a state of dying continuously and without stop, without dying. 'They shall have their portion in the pool burning with fire and brimstone' It is called the second death or the final death (Apoc. 20:14; 21:8; 2:11; 1 John 5:17). The idle words spoken by men are punished with a short period of detention in Purgatory and then they are released.Therefore, there is the punishment of hell, the eternal punishment which is the second death for the sin which\"},{\"question\":\"6. What is the way of remission of sins?\",\"id\":6,\"value\":\"We have heard many arguments about what sin is. We also have heard that it is alright if it is acceptable to one's own conscience, and that no human help is necessary to be absolved from sin. Let us see a little what the holy will of God is, regarding this.What is sin?'Whosoever commits sin violates the commandment of God. For sin is nothing but the violation of the commandment of God' (1 John 3:4).\\nrenders one subject to this second death, and for lesser crimes, that is, for venial sins, a temporary punishment for some time is given by God. Then there will be liberation also (2 Cor. 1:31, 32).The status or the duration of these punishments depend upon the sinful condition of the soul when it is separated from the body through the first death in this world!Is it possible that sin could be forgiven in the next world?'...He who will speak against the Holy Ghost will not be forgiven neither in this world, nor in the world to come' (Matt. 12:32). When we reverse this sentence, we understand that he who will not speak against the Holy Ghost will be forgiven also in the world to come! Is denying this word of Our Lord Himself, a symbol of knowledge? And there is a sin which does not bring about the final death' (1 John 5:17); a person who dies with only this kind of venial sin, cannot be punished with hell, which is the final death! He has to be purged from his sin in order to be released later. Who will help him in this? We, who are still alive in this world, are the ones who must help him.Is it right for us to pray, do penances and reparations and have Masses celebrated for thedead that they might be forgiven?'(Christ) enlivened in the Spirit. In that Spirit He went and preached to those spirits that were in prison' (1 Pet. 3;19); 'Death and abyss gave up their dead which were in them' (Apoc. 20:14); 'I will deliver them out of the hand of the abyss' (Osee 13:14).From these words, it is conceivable that there is an abyss in between heaven and hell, where those who die with smaller sins (and those who have been forgiven of their greater sins through the Sacrament of Penance, but did not complete their reparation for them in this world through their temporal punishments) are purged from their sins; This is in absolute harmony with the words of Jesus Himself, uttered as those of Abraham to the rich man in hell, 'There is fixed a great abyss (chaos) between us and you' (Luke 16:26).'Save others, pulling them out of the fire' (Jude 1:23); he will be saved, yet so as by fire' (1 Cor. 3:15); 'He who knows his brother to commit a sin which is not to death (and die with that sin), let him pray for him' (1 John 5:16).If one can help others in sinning, and if one can pray and do penance for another, then helping those who are dead by praying and doing penance for them must also be possible. And we have at any cost help them! Those who deny this truth will be culpable of commiting sin against\\n\\n\\ncharity. Can't we help them with our mammon of iniquity, make friends and help them enter into everlasting tabernacles! (Luke 16:9).'And the money received which was contributed by the children of Israel, you will deliver for the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord, and He may be merciful to their souls' (Exodus 30:16; 2 Kings 12:4). 'He sent twelve thousand drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the resurrection... It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins (2 Mach 12:43,46). Therefore it is absolutely right to pray, do penances and have Masses said for the souls of the dead! And it is absolutely urgent too!Is it not ridiculous that those who say that there is no forgiveness in the next word, pray for their dead?As it was told to Josuah: 'Behold, I have taken away your iniquity, and have clothed you with excellent garment' (Zach. 3:4), he was given to private judgment and was forgiven. Think of it and understand it!'I saw Satan like lightning falling from heaven' (Luke10:18). 'Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall all indeed rise again; but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet' (1 Cor. 15:51,52). Thus, when one's destiny will be decided in the twinkling of an eye, if there is no way for forgiveness in the next world, will it be of any avail, if the Protestant pastors and the others pray saying, 'God, give us eternal peace'? Is there anyone who do not want the dead receiving eternal rest? If it is useful to pray heartily, is it not right to pray?What is our duty in helping for the forgiveness of the dead?If they speak against the truth saying that through prayer, penances and Masses, we could never obtain the remission of sins for the dead, and thus abandon them to the fires of purgatory, which torture without killing, they will also find the same destiny soon. Earlier debt is the same as the later debt. One must reap what he sowed. At that time, the truth only will win, eternity will kill. We have hundreds of facts of innumerable suffering souls of purgatory, coming to this world and begging holy people to help them to obtain the forgiveness of their sins. Do they have the heart to realize and help these poor souls? Aren't we obliged to help our deceased relatives to obtain for them the remission of sins?\\n\\nIs it right for us to look for human help for the remission of our sins, even in this world?Can it be proved that those who said 'No' to this question, did not seek human help? If they say they didn't, is it not in itself their oral testimony to the fact that they are liars?Why go to others for baptism to be cleansed from the original sin? Why? Why should not they baptize themselves without going to others, nor seeking human help?Do they have any right and merit to judge the Roman Catholics who go to a priest for the absolution of their sins?They say that God would directly forgive their sins. But, even when God has not told them to go to others for baptism, why do they go to others for baptism, to be cleansed of original sin?Does God command to receive absolution of sins through men, through priests?Yes. He has commanded to receive absolution through men and then come to Him: He ordered Abimelech to receive forgiveness through Abraham (Gen. 20:7), and Job's friends through Job: '...My servant Job will pray for you: I will accept his face that folly be not imputed to you'(Job 42:8);'The priest will pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them' (Numbers 15:25). 'The priest will pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him' (Levi. 4:26,31,35). 'Let him confess his sins to the priest and be forgiven (Levi 5:5; 6:7,15; 2 Sam. 12:18). Thus, God has arranged for the remission of sins through priests! No one can deny it!In the times of the New Testament, people went to St. John the Baptist to receive baptism, confessing their sins (Matt. 3:6). And St. Paul says that God has given to them the ministry of reconciliation (of souls with God) (2 Cor. 5:18).Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself also, when He cured the lepers, commanded them to show themselves to the priests and offer the gifts which Moses commanded for a testimony unto them (Matt. 8:4).Go to God, having your sins absolved by a priest!Eventually, Our Lord has mandated everyone to come to Him after being forgiven by a priest in these very clear words, which He told His apostles: 'Whose sins you will forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' (John 20:23). After uttering these words,\\nHe has gone to His eternal abode, the doors of which have been closed. Nevertheless, the keys to open them are with St. Peter (Matt. 16:19). He is the guide to the lambs and sheep (John 21:15,16,17). He says, 'Come after being forgiven by a priest and I will open the gates of heaven for you,' but you divulge your absurdity and folly by saying, 'We will receive forgiveness straight from God, we will knock at the door like those imprudent five virgins. After disclaiming the power of reconciliation bestowed upon priests by Christ Himself, if you beg Him, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us' (Matt. 25:11), do you think He would open it? Never! What will He say to those who have forgotten His words: 'Not every one who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord' will enter into the Kingdom of heaven, who does not do the will of the Father Who is in heaven' (Matt. 7:21)'? He would reply, saying: 'I never knew you' (Matt. 25:12). To those who have not fulfilled His will, He would say, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matt. 25:41). If you do not want to hear these words from Him, then go to Him after being absolved of sins by the priests of His own Church!\"},{\"question\":\"7. What is the Bread that gives Eternal Life?\",\"id\":7,\"value\":\"Today, there exists many conceptions which say that the Holy Eucharist of Our Lord Jesus Christ is nothing but mere bread, It is not the Body of Christ and therefore It should not be adored. Let us see how true these statements are!Why does Our Lord give us the Holy Eucharist as our Bread?As food is indispensable for us to have physical strength and energy, we also need the spiritual Bread, the Eucharist so that our soul could be strong and energetic. Morevoer, God did not create everything to provide only the physical food to Adam and Eve; No! but He brought forth... the tree of life also in the midst of paradise, (Gen. 2:9) and made them eat its fruits. But Eve, the first woman was deceived by Satan who came in the disguise of a serpent (Apoc. 12:9; Gen. 3:4) and ate the fruit of death (Gen. 2:17) especially the one which would deliver man to the second death (that is, to the punishment of hell), thus becoming the way of sin and death into the world. But God deigned to feed us with another Fruit, the Fruit of the Most Holy Womb (Luke 1:42), thus providing us with the Life-giving Bread (John 6:35) in lieu of the evil fruit that brings death and that\\n\\nhas made the consipracy of Satan null and void. Knowing only too well the impertinence of the devil who even dared to approach Our Lord Himself and tempted Him to change stones into bread and satisfy His hunger (Matt. 4:3), He has given Himself as our bread so that we can overcome the devil. He lives in us through this Sacred Bread and wins the devil in us. He gives It to us so that we could have strength and energy to avoid the second death and go to the Eternal Life.Is it essential to communicate frequently?Our Lord taught us to pray our Father in heaven to give us today our daily bread (Matt. 6:11). Therefore it is utmost necessary to consume this greater food of the soul worthily (1 Cor. 11;28) everyday, thereby getting more Food which is the Holy Eucharist.Is Jesus there in the Holy Eucharist?Can Jesus and His Body be separated? No! They can't be. It is just because of this, Our Lord, before He ascended to heaven (Acts. 1:9), said to His Apostles, 'Why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See My hands and feet, that it is I Myself; handle and see: for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see Me to have' (Luke 24:38,39). Thus He proves that He had resurrected with His true Body, and without leaving It in this world,He ascended to heaven, enclosed by this Body. And He comes to this world in the form of Eucharist with this Body. He asks those who do not believe, why such thoughts arise in their hearts.If the body separates itself from the person, will it be alive? If you say that Jesus is not in the Holy Eucharist, do you eat His dead body? Generally, a dead body is subject to decomposition. Does a body liable to corruption become a living bread? Is the corruptible food, capable of making one incorruptible (1 Cor. 15:50)? Therefore, do you still not understand that these statements are contrary to truth?While Jesus says again and again very clearly, 'I am the bread of life' (John 6:35, 48), 'He who eats Me, will live by Me' (John 6:57) and 'I am the Living Bread which came down from heaven' (John 6:41,51), thus proving that He is the spiritual food, can any one who denies it, not be said as insane? Did the Body of Christ only come down from heaven as food? 'Behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world' - this is the promise of Christ Himself (Matt. 28:20). Have they not yet understood that this promise is being fulfilled everyday by Him by being the Eucharist Itself, by being in the Tabernacles of the Holy Catholic Church? He Who is God in the Eucharist deserves adoration! On so many occasions, Our Lord has shown Himself\\n\\n\\nfrom the Sacred Bread in the form of a child, or a grown up person and has spoken to many. There are plenty of testimonies to this fact (See: 'Thursday Miracles' book). Therefore may the doubts be put aside! May the truth that Jesus is living in the Eucharist felt by everyone!Is it right to say no to medicine and yes to feast (food)?'Those who are healthy do not need the physician, but those who are ill do' said Our Lord (Matt. 9:12; Jer. 8:22); God created medicine for our use; He cured King Ezechias through Isaias by laying a lump of figs as a plaster upon the wound, that it should be cured (2 Kings 20:7; Isai. 38:21); He has spoken about using balm (Jer. 46:11), healing leaves (Apoc. 22:2; Ezec. 47:12) etc. Our Lord Jesus Christ speaks highly about the good Samaritan who saved the man who was wounded and left half dead, by pouring in oil and wine (Luke 10:34, 37). Above all these, it is written that 'The Most High has created medicines out of the earth, and a wise man will not abhor them' (Sirach 38:4,5). It will be incredibly unwise to say no to medicines after all these things!This is a challenge - is any one ready to accept it?Even after our Lord has said, 'The kingdom of Godis not meat and drink' (Rom. 14:17), and again, 'Man lives not in bread alone, but in every word which proceeds from the mouth of God' (Matt. 4:4; Deut. 8:3), why do those who say that they have been anointed with the Holy Ghost, and who deny using medicine against any of their bodily ailment, search for food for the body? Why do they feast sumptuously, who say no to medicines? Will they be ready to live by the word which comes from the mouth of God itself, through the Spirit of Life, without eating anything else? Can they live for good without food? Are they ready to say that God would take care of them? They will have the true power, when they walk along the path of Truth, won't they?Therefore, do not be deceived. Don't sacrifice yourselves to the spirit of falsehood that misleads. Understand that the Spirit of Truth acts in the Roman Catholic Church only.St. Clara who lived without food for 28 years, St. Catherine of Siena and St. Alexandrina who lived for months, had been under the care of others. There are enough proofs of these. And through these facts, God has shown His True Church to the world.\\n\\nto an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defied' (1Cor. 8:7), St. Paul points out the idols of the false gods of the heatherns which existed until then. While God has forbidden the worship of the idols of stars, the sun, and the moon in Deut. 4:15-19, of men and women such as kings and queens (Wis.14:17-20), of reptiles and birds, and has commanded saying 'Do not worship strange gods' (Jer. 35:5) and again, 'Do not make to yourself a graven image of those things which the Lord has forbidden to be made' (Deut. 4:23), it is not right to say that we would have to avoid worshipping or venerating things which the Lord has not forbidden to be made. And nobody can prove that the Roman Catholics have been worshipping the images which God has forbidden.Images are made of the slime of the earth, so they are impure: is it right?If images are made of the earth and so they are impure, then aren't you who have been created from the slime of the earth also impure (Gen 2:7)?

Similarly God is powerful to work wonders through stone and earth (Num.20:7,8). That blind man had understood this truth. Don't you?Is it right to say that carrying images is wrong, for they are mortal?Is not it raving in delirium to say that carrying images--would be destroyed at the consummation of the world?

Where were you for the last 1500 years? And who gave you authority to preach as you wish and interrogate the Roman Catholic Church?Why do they oppose the veneration of images while accepting other things?As Our Lord said, 'Behold I make everything new' (Apoc. 21:5), you accept 'a new heaven and a new earth' (Apoc. 21:1; Isai. 66:22), the new covenant (Luke 22:20; Jer. 31: 31,32), a new Sacrifice (Matt. 26:28, Hebr. 9:25), a new priest (Heb. 5:10), a new food (John 6:58), a new Gospel (Luke 16:16), a new commandment (Matt. 5:21-44; John 13:34), a new head (Matt. 16:18), a new authority ( Matt. 16:18,19; John 21:15-17). If it is right to accept all these, isn't it wrong to deny only a new veneration, the veneration of images after the new creation, under a new leadership, and according to a new authority? Was not the Jewish Law emptied? (Eph. 2:15).He Who first made an image is God Himself!God is the One who made images at first. He is the One who made the image of Adam with clay (Gen. 2:7) and changed Lot's wife into a statue of salt (Gen. 19:26)!It is again God Himself Who instructed to make images in the Old Testament! He is the One Who instructed to make two Cherubims out of gold plates (Exod. 25:18) and the image of a brazen serpent (Numbers 21:8). Those who oppose images, are those who oppose God Himself!God commands to make images in the New Testament!The reason why God did not show Himself in the beginning is that being deceived, man could have made images of Him similar to birds or beasts of the earth (Deut. 4:14-19). If after saying this, the Christ was shown as the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15), is it not because He wanted His images made? Is not the figure of Christ adorable?\\n\\n\\nDoesn't Jesus Our Lord say, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believe in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting' (John 3:14,15)? By these words, doesn't He show that as Moses lifted the image of the serpent, the image of the Suffering Jesus must also lifted to remind the faithful to meditate upon the passions and the death of Christ and the sins which caused them and live a pure life avoiding sin? When Our Lord Jesus was asked whether it is just to pay taxes to Caesar, He, showing the figure of Caesar on the coin and remarked, 'Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar (that is, the image of Caesar to him) and the things that are God's, to God' (Matt. 22:21-22). He did not ask them to make coin! Or Couldn't He have answered without showing the figure on the coin? Therefore giving the figure of God to Him, or the image of His saintly friends to them, or venerate them was not denied. On the contrary, we are asked to do things in this way.God's action through stones, sand, wood, and metals.Moses spoke to the rock, and made water emerging from it by hitting it with his wooden staff (Numbers 20:7,8). Our Lord said the stones would sing hosannas to Him (Luke 19:40) and the mountain would remove itself and be cast intothe sea (Mark 11:23). God did wonders through the staff of Moses (Exod. 7:10; 17:6). Jesus applied earth in the eyes of a blind man and restored him to sight with it (John 9:6,7). He acted through the handkerchief of St. Paul (Acts. 19:12), shadow of St. Peter (Acts. 5:15), and His own garment (Matt. 9:20,21). He acted through the image of the brazen serpent (Num. 21:8). If God can act in these ways, why can't He act through the image of the Saints?The things and the days which are in contact of God, become holy.If the paper and ink which come into contact with the word of God, and become the `Bible', is found to be venerable, why can't the statues of saints made of stone, clay, wood, metal, etc. be so?The Sabbath day (Gen 2:3), and the earthenware which touched the sacrificed meat (Levi. 6:27, 28) became holy! Does not the ordinary bread made of wheat flour becomes the adorable Body of Christ (Matt. 26:216), after it is sanctified with Our Lord's words of consecration?According as St. Peter says that '...it is sanctified by the word of God and (our) prayer' (1 Tim. 4:5), the statues of the saints too become sacred by being sanctified by the prayer of the Church and with Holy\\n\\nWater! They also become worthy of our veneration and respect!God demands the veneration of Saints.Are we not adoring Our Lord even when He never asked us to do so? As it was said, 'If you salute your brethren only, what do you more?' (Matt. 5:47), if you venerate God only, what greater thing are you doing? Our Lord asks us to venerate the saints who are the brothers of Himself and us (Matt. 12:50) who loved Jesus most, who gave their life for Him and who fulfilled His will. If it is right to salute our teachers, elders and leaders, it is also right to venerate the saints in every way, even through their images!God has instructed us to remember saints through their images.It is right to remember the saints through their images (Do in remembrance - Joshua 4:6; Luke 22:19) and ask for the help of their prayers!The Apostles also exercised the veneration of images!St. Thomas who came to India through Malangara (Kerala) in 54 AD, brought with himself the portrait of Our Lady painted by the versatile painter and the Evangelist, St. Luke, another picture of Her with words in Aramaic on itand a cross. These are in the altar of the mount church of St. Thomas, in Chennai even today. The famous church built by the Apostle St. James is still there in Paris. From these, it is well understood that even the Apostles had accepted and were exercising the veneration of images of Saints!The veneration of images praised by Saints!Our Lady Herself appeared to Sister Catherine Laboure in France on the 27th of November, 1830 and asked her to make an image of Herself. Are you more wise than St. Francis Xavier, St. Antony of Padua, St. Dominic, etc. who, being filled with Holy Ghost, worked so many wonders, reviving the dead and converted countless people to Christianity? Are you the ones filled by the Holy Ghost? Can you prove it?Not the image, but the person it depicts is the one who is venerated.That adoration (latria) is one thing, and veneration (dulia) is another, is the Ecclesial Law. Saints are only venerated, not adored.When a person prays inside a room, if the wall is before his eyes, will you say that he prays to the stone, or the sand of the wall? Or if he prays looking above, will you say he prays to the beam in the roof? Is it right?\\n\\nSimilarly, when we pray before the statues of saints, we remember the saint implied by the statue and pray to him, or her, and not to the stone, earth or wood which has been used to make it. Understand this!Likewise, it is true that the veneration rendered is also not indeed rendered to the image, but to the person it signifies.He who resists this truth, will he say when a photo of him or the Bible or the pictures of elders such as Mahatma Gandhi would be trampled on by others, that it is not insulting to him, or the Bible or Gandhiji? Even though they have been made of paper, ink, etc., won't he say that the persons they signify are respected or insulted? If a statue of Gandhiji is broken by someone, will he not say that it is a disrespect to Gandhiji? Would you avoid saluting our national tricolor, looking it as a mere cloth? Aren't we paying our homage to our motherland through it? Will you not say that these things are right?Just like these, we venerate the saints through their images made of stone, clay or wood. Is it not utmost folly to resist this without realizing that we venerate the saint and not the image which implies the saint? So, veneration of saints through their images is absolutely acceptable!Even after they died, they are living in heaven!'Jesus Christ is the first begotten of the dead' (Apoc. 1:5). Therefore, the others who were risen become the next to this First-Born.On the same day when Lord Jesus died, 'the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose, and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, came to the holy city and appeared to many' (Matt. 27:52,53). Jesus Christ, 'enlivened in the Spirit in which He came and preached to those spirits which were in prison' (1 Pet. 3:19).The souls of the dead pray in heaven (Apoc. 6:9,10); twenty four elders adore God in heaven (Apoc. 4:4); At the time of Our Lord's transfiguration, Moses who was dead appeared and spoke to Him (Matt. 17:3). The Church Victorious is crowding heaven, overjoyed with festivities (Heb. 12:13).Lazarus who was poor, is sitting in the bosom of Abraham (Luke 16:23); Josuah has secured a position in heaven (Zach. 3:7). Abraham has seen Jesus in an apparition (John 8:56). The thief on the right has gone to heaven on the very same day when he died (Luke 23:43); Men from heaven have come to the aid of people on the earth (2 Kings\\n\\n6:16,17).The dead people were active!Did not Our Lord Jesus Christ and St. Peter speak to Lazarus who was dead (John 11:43), the son of the widow of Naim (Luke 7:14), the daughter of Jairus (Mark 5:41), and Tabitha (Acts 9:40)? Did not God work a wonder through the bones of prophet Eliseus (2 Kings 13:21)? That God Who has done all these things, help us when we pray to the saints through their images, remembering them is an indisputable truth! And denying this is the sign of ignorance. Even today, Our Lady, as our Lady of Velankanni, Our Lady of Lourdes, etc. and many saints such as St. Antony of Padua are providing the faithful with innumerable helps through so many miracles! And those who have clear eyes, clear ears and a good mind will understand this.God Himself has helped people through images!Will not God, Who gave grace, forgiveness and salvation even through the image of the accursed serpent (Numbers 21:8; Gen. 3:15), do much more miraculous helps through Her, Who is the blessed among women, Who is full of grace, Who has the Lord with Her (Luke 1:28, 42), and Who is the Blessed Mother of Christ and our Most Holy Mother (John19:27)? As a matter of fact, He has been continuing to do innumerable favors to us through Her!Our Lord, just as He ascended to heaven with His incorruptible Body, also assumed His Holy Mother Who gave Him a human Body, with Her Most Holy Body, not letting it corrupted. Let us believe and realize this Truth! She, being in the abode of heaven, has been appearing in many places of the earth and assisting us in many ways. There are plenty of proofs to these facts. She appeared at Fatima in Portugal on the 13th of July, 1917 for the third time, and announced that Russia would be converted.God Himself has instructed men to come to Him through others!Didn't God show Himself and say to Abimelech (Gen. 20:17) and the friends of Job (Job 42:8) not to come directly to Him but to ask for His assistance by praying to Him through others? Don't you too ask for prayers from good, holy people?At the marriage at Cana, though His time had not yet come, God who commanded us to honour our father and mother (Exod. 20:12), submitting Himself to His own commandment, heard His Mother's request and worked His first miracle, thus solving the problem faced by the bridegroom. Thus He has given example to us to ask for\\n\\n\\nhelp through His Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary! As shown by Him, let us approach our Holy Mother and receive rare succors through Her from Him! Therefore, the veneration of the images is right! And so is the receiving of succors through prayers to the saints which the images imply!\"},{\"question\":\"9. Is Devotion to the Mother of God necessary?\",\"id\":9,\"value\":\"Today many people preach and argue against the devotion to Our Mother and Her veneration and it can be widely seen everywhere. Some even accept this resistence to Our Lady. However, since sanctification and redemption come through the Truth (John 17:17; 8:31,32) and since 'all who have not believed the Truth, but have consented to iniquity will be judged' (2 Thess.2:12), it would be a good arrangement to understand the Truth; and this is ever the principle we have to grasp well!Can we venerate our Mother?It is nowhere said in the Bible not to pay veneration to the Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary! God has commanded us to venerateour parents (Exod. 20:12), and to honour the angels (Exod. 23:20,21). Therefore it is right to pay homage to Mother Mary Who was given to us as our Mother by the Savior from the cross (John 19:27)!Is it right to say that only one is the Mediator?It would not be right to say that no other mediator or no other person who prays for us is necessary as it is written that 'there is one God and one Mediator of God and man, the Man, Christ Jesus' (1 Tim. 2:5).Moses has been the mediator, the person who prays for others many times (Exod. 32:30, 31; Num. 21:7). Even the Holy Ghost pray for us (Rom. 8:27). St. Paul says that they have been given the ministry of reconciliation (2 Cor. 5:18)! Don't we ask holy people to pray for us?As our Mother has worked as the mediator between Jesus and the people and prayed to Him for them, it is perfectly right to have Her as our Mediator and One Who pray for us.To say that we have to pray directly to God:There are some people who are obstinate in saying that we must pray to God directly and it is not right to pray through others and ask for help. But God has told Abimelech\\n(Gen. 20:7) and the friends of Job (Job 42:8) to pray through others and obtain favors from Him. And Was St. Paul in the wrong when he asked others to pray for him (Eph. 6:20; Heb. 13:17; 1 Thess.5:25)?It is necessary to pray through Our Mother and obtain miraculous favors following the example of Our Lord Jesus Christ Who hinted to us to come to Him through His Mother, through the episode of the marriage of Cana, at which He, hearing the prayer of His Mother, worked a miracle, even before the arrival of His time to give testimony to His Apostolic Mission through His miracles!Can we say that the dead cannot help us?There are also people who say that the dead would not rise to life until the final judgment day, and that there is no use in praying to them. Is this statement true? Many rose from their tombs on the same day when Our Lord gave His life (Matt. 27:52). Such resurrection has so many proofs. Likewise, there are many proofs for also the assumption of Our Lady to heaven after being dead for three days and raised from the dead at Her age of 73 (Call of Love, p.230). As a sign of this, She appeared as the Mother of Jesus Christ Whom 'She brought forth, Who was to rule all nations with an iron rod' (Apoc. 12:5), as the glorious and powerful Mother, and as the Woman Who showed Herself as a greatsign in heaven (Apoc. 12:1).There are many evidences to the fact that Our Mother, coming from that heavenly abode, has appeared in many places such as Velankanni some centuries ago, in Lourdes, France, on the 11th of February 1858 onwards (18 times), in Fatima, Portugal since May 13, 1917 (6 times) and showering spiritual and temporal graces and favors upon people who approaches Her and no one can dare to deny them. Has anyone have guts to deny the miraculous favors of our Lady such as restoring sight to the blind people since their birth, curing the lame, the dumb and deaf etc.? Can they who are powerless to do so, utter any word about this?To say that not much has been said in the Bible about the Blessed Virgin:There is not much said in the Bible about the Father and the Holy Ghost too regarding Their divinity. So, can you say, they are not so important?! As women are generally modest, it is natural that the words spoken about them are only a few. And this is the tradition of the Bible.The world cannot contain everything done by Jesus, if they should be written (John 21:25). These words perfectly apply to the acts of Our Lady too. Those who wrote the New Testament were only eight! But as it is written as a prophesy: 'And Your own soul shall be pierced by a\\n\\n\\nsword, that out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed' (Luke 2:35), innumerable thought have been revealing themselves about the glory, power, wisdom, mercy and the saving power of Our Most Holy Mother! Can anyone have an account for them? Is there a way to count the number of the churches dedicated to Her, number of devotions to Her and the books written on Her?The glory of Our Mother is inestimable:The Blessed Mother of Christ is standing on the moon, as the Mother of the Church which is His mystical body, clothed with the sun and wearing a diadem of twelve stars (Apoc. 12:1). She is the Mother of God (Luke 1:43), the Blessed (Luke 1:45), blessed among women (Luke 1:42), Woman full of grace and conceived without the original sin (Luke 1:28), One Who received the grace of God (Luke 1:30), the most glorious Queen of heaven and earth Who brought forth the King of kings (Apoc. 17:14), the One Who received the authority from God to crush the head of Satan (Gen. 3:15). Is it not good for us to try and obtain Her favor in order to overcome Satan? In the age old conflict and the dissention inflicted by God Himself between Satan and the Woman (the Blessed Mother Mary) (Gen. 3:15), all the schismatic sects which call themselves 'churches', have always been on Satan's side opposing and resisting Her and speaking false slanders and blasphemies about Her, thus proving that they are 'the synagogue of Satan' (Apoc. 2:9).Mother Mary is the Mother of the redeemed:Eve was the woman who brought sin, curse and the anger of God upon mankind. And she was the mother (of sin) of all the living (Gen. 3:20). When the Christ Who is the Second Adam Who came into this world to remove sin and the curse (Rom. 5:14) was carrying out His redeeming mission, He gave His own Mother as the Mother of salvation to those who are to be redeemed (John 19:27). Therefore, it is our obligation to dedicate ourselves as children under this Mother's protection! As it is written: 'And the dragon was angry against the Woman and went to make war with the rest of Her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ' (12:17), is it not easily conceivable that only the children of the Mother of God who keep the commandments of God would be redeemed?!She is the channel through which the grace of God descends upon Her children!If Christ is the Head (Col. 1:18), then after Him, it is His Mother Who provided Him with a body is the second important part of the mystical body, she is the neck which connects the Head with the rest of the Body (1 Cor.\\n\\n12:27)! And anything can pass from the head to the body only through the neck. As Christ, as the Savior of mankind, willed to come through the Blessed Virgin, so is God willing that the grace which is the fruit of redemption must also come from Him to mankind through Her. Christ Who gives reward to those who would give a cup of water to the Christians because they belong to Him (Mark. 9:41), won't He accept the veneration and glory rendered to His Mother Who brought forth and raised Him and gave Him a Body which was to be sacrificed for the redemption, and reward them who glorify Her?The Blessed Virgin is the One conceived without sin.One can get the wages in advance for the work to be done tomorrow, can't he? Similarly, in view of the future merits which Our Lord Jesus Christ would earn through His passions, He cleansed the original sin from the soul of His Precursor, St. John the Baptist and filled him with Sanctifying Grace Luke 1:41,44). In the same manner, with the same merits, He created His Most Holy Mother even before, absolutely preserved from the stain of the original sin. Would it be fitting according to the divine justice to Jesus Who came to the world to take away the sins of the world to take a sinful body from a sinful woman? This is exactly why OurLord Jesus made only His own Mother Mary to be born in a special way, without the curse of sin and full of grace (Luke 1:28), and as the Blessed among women (Luke 1:42). God Himself greets Her through Archangel Gabriel saying that the Lord is with Her (Luke 1:28). If a man needs a woman of this world who was cursed later (Gen. 2:18), he needs this blessed woman, his mother, one who is full of grace in a much more greater degree for his spiritual life. It is the woman who makes and she is the one who destroys! But everything done by this Woman is nothing but good! And there is no damnation awaiting us if we walk along Her path! Therefore, it is the association of this Woman, the Mother of God and men, to escape from the destruction of sin and curse, which one must certainly look for.Were there other children too than Jesus to Our Mother?Is it just to speak ill of Our Mother, without realizing the importance of the words, 'Cursed be he who does not honour his father and mother' (Deut. 27:16; Sirach 3:18)? Doesn't one speak against God Himself Who preserved His Mother as a virgin (Isai. 7:14), when he says that Mary had other children and She was not a virgin? Is a man a son only to his own mother who brought him forth? Don't we call brothers and sisters who are our cousins? Could not James,\\nJoseph, Simon and Jude (Matt. 13:55), be the sons of the sister of the Mother of our Lord and the wife of Cleophas, named Mary, who stood beside the cross of Jesus with His Mother? (John 19:25). Note that this Jude, while calling James as his brother, calls himself as the servant of Jesus (Jude 1:1). And also note that this Mary is called as the mother of Joseph in Mark 15:47 and again as the mother of James in 16:1. St. Matthew also calls her as the mother of James and Joseph (27:56).Can any one prove that the Mother of Jesus conceived other children, begot and raised them, or took them along with Jesus and Joseph according to the Mosaic Law to the Temple of Jerusalem for the Passover? (Exod. 12:21; Levi. 23:5; 1 Sam. 1:3-5, Deut. 16:16).It is only because She had no other children to support Her, Our Lord being on the cross, entrusted Her to His beloved Apostle, St. John, didn't He?Does the Bible anywhere mention the Mother of Christ as `their Mother' meaning She was also the Mother of other children, where She and Her Son were there together, at the marriage of Cana, for instance? (John 2:12; 19:25; Matt. 12:46, 47, Luke 8:19, Mark 3:31). If St. Joseph did not know Her until she gave birth to Jesus (Matt. 1:25), will it mean that he knew Her later? Our Lord promised, ' Iam with you all days, even to the consummation of the world' (Matt.28;20) will it mean that afterwards He would not continue to be so? If someone says that Jesus did not marry a woman until his death, I wonder if you would say that He afterwards got married!! This word `until' has a number of examples in the Bible itself. (See 1 Tim. 4:13, Gen. 8:6,7; Isai. 46:4, 22:14; Ps. 109:1; Matt. 12:20). After this, never dare to blab that Mother Mary had other children!In fact, `Virgin' is another name of Mary, the Mother of Christ! She has been mentioned as `Virgin' at the episode of Annunciation (Luke 1:26); Isaias says, 'A Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son' ((7:14) (Matt. 1:22). Will this name fit to Her if she had borne other children ? If so, God and His Archangel could have called Her Virgin until She gave birth to Jesus. As it is not said so, Our Mother is a Virgin for eternity. Therefore the dignified people can always praise our dearmost Mother as Virgin Mary!According to the Bible, the Rosary is the most eminent prayer which God loves.Some people who are in a schismatic sect says that God or the spirit is with them. But through their chaotic shouting, they prove by their action that God is very far from them. If it were true that God is near them, they would not have needed to make such an irritating noise as if to reach\\nsomeone who is too far. This noise is of course, necessary to catch someone who is very far. Propher Elias also said the same (1 Kings 18:27).But our Lord instructs us, 'When you are praying, do not blabber much, as the heathens do' (Matt. 6:7). Moreover, vomitting whatever comes in one's tongue, shouting, blabbering, or pretending as if one had the gift of the word of wisdom, or diverse tongues cannot be accepted by Jesus as a prayer. He would say no to these prayers, but He teaches us the method of praying (Matt. 6:9) At least after this, let us admit that He would not accept those who do not accept what He teaches! Let us pray according to the way He teaches us!'Our Father, Who art in heaven... lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil' is a Scriptural prayer, isn't it? (Matt. 6:9-13). The extraordinary prayer, the `Hail Mary' is nothing but the synthesis of the words of God the Father, 'Hail, full of grace; the Lord is with Thee' (Luke 1:28) with which He, Who wanted to change the condition of the world which had been changed into a desert by sin, greets His beloved Daughter through His Archangel (Luke 1:28), and the salutation of Elizabeth after she was filled with the Holy Ghost, 'Blessed art Thou amongst women, and blessed is the Fruit of Thy womb, Jesus' (Luke 1:41, 42,), along withthe annexed prayer prescribed by the Church, 'Holy Mary, Mother of God (Luke 1:43), pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death (Matt. 24:44). Amen' (2 Cor. 1:20).With this Scriptural prayers, another prayer from the Bible, 'In the Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, (Matt. 28:19) Amen' was added and this Rosary of Scriptural prayers was given to us by Our Lady Herself through St. Dominic in the 13th century, to be prayed with the meditation of the Mystery of Salvation. Moreover, She promised through the same saint to shower immense graces through this heavenly prayer. Besides, She has shown Herself in Fatima, Lourdes etc. and asked us to pray this Rosary. And many popes, especially Popes Leo XIII, St. Pius V, St. Pius X, Pius XII, and John Paul II have asked us to pray the Rosary, a true Scriptual prayer, as frequently as possible. Let us pray more and more this! By means of it, peace will reign in the families, heresies removed, the spiritual life will excel. Let us endeavor to gain the riches of grace for ourselves and the country through praying Rosary. Let us obtain graces by praying the Simple, Scriptural prayer, the Rosary devoutly!Explain the word, 'Rosary.'Rosary is the garland of beautiful prayer. And a garland is nothing but a circular structure in which variety of\\n\\n\\nbeautiful flowers are tied again and again and knotted connecting the two ends. Not realizing this, some people find fault in repeating a few prayers many times. Some say that praying a decade is enough. Are they speaking in the right way, thus denying the requests of Our Lady, the saints and the Popes? Are these more gifted with wisdom and other gifts of the Holy Ghost than St. Dominic, St. Xavier and St. Antony of Padua who had a special devotion for the Rosary, spread it and through it, revived even three dead people? Recognize these servants of the devil who tend to remove you from God by their blabbing of denial of the Rosary and calling others to the prayer of chaos renounced by God Himself. Do not enter the path of perdition. If God was right in seeking the association of Our Lady, how much more must we seek Her succor?\"},{\"question\":\"10. Can we accept anyone as a preacher?\",\"id\":10,\"value\":\"'Are all apostles? Are all prophets?...Do all interpret?' (1 Cor. 12:29,31). According to these words, not all are apostles or preachers. We suffer by a lot of distresses through these people 'who say that they are apostles, and are not, and (you) have found them liars' (Apoc. 2:2). Theiracting and pretention know no bounds! St. Paul warns us saying, 'Such false apostles are deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no wonder: for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be according to their works' (2 Cor. 11:13-15). If we accept the preaching of these false apostles who pretend in order to entangle us in the deceitful snares of Satan, thus destroying us and casting us into hell, then damnation will be our end, the eternal hell will be our destiny. Is this necessary?1. False apostles were chased away!1. Our Lord chased away Satan who pretended as if helping Him to appease His hunger by asking Him to change stones into bread and eat them (Matt. 4:3,4).2. Even when Satan bore testimony to the words of St. Paul saying, 'These men are the servants of the Most High God, who preach to you the way of salvation' (Acts. 16:17), St. Paul drove it away (acts. 16:18).3. Even the devils did not accept the false apostles who used the Name of Jesus and they put them to flight (Acts. 19:13-16).4. Though they say to Our Lord Jesus 'Lord, have we not\\n\\nprophesied in Your Name?' (Matt. 7:22,23), He chases them away saying, 'Depart from Me, you who work iniquity!'The time will definitely come when Our Lord will chase into everlasting hell, those who do not drive away these false apostles. Therefore, never accept these false apostles, never turn an ear to them, and drive them away!2. False apostles were punished!1. God punished Aaron and Miriam who spoke against Moses and equalled themselves to him (Numbers 12:2,10).2. The earth opened and devoured Dathan, Core and Abiron who dared to burn incense speaking against Moses. A fire scorched the others. (Numbers 16:2; 16, 17, 33).3. God punished king Ozias who dared to burn incense before the altar with leprosy (2 Para. 26:18,19).Even though these people came forward to burn incense and worship Him, God did not accept it, but punished them instead. If we accept in the same way the false apostles, saying they also preach Jesus, they have nothing other than Bible, they preach good things, etc., let us realize that we would also day by day, become the children of Satan through his messengers and would undergo punishment! Let us not accept these false apostles!3. Signs of false apostles:1. 'These are those who separate themselves' (Jude 1:19);2. '(They are) ever learning, and never attaining to the know ledge of the Truth' (2 Tim. 3:7);3. 'According to their own desires, they will heap to themselves preachers, having itching ears' (2 Tim. 4:3);4. 'Through covetousness, shall they make merchandise of you with feigned words' (2 Pet. 2:3).5. 'They suppose gain to be godliness' (1 Tim. 6:5).Therefore, we must identify these false apostles who oppose the only, true Church (Matt. 16:18) established by Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Roman Catholc Church (Dan. 2:44,45; 7:23-27), by creating schism, introducing new doctrines everydy, and who produces numerous preachers and sects. We must separate ourselves from them and walk along the true path of redemption.4. Identification of the true Apostles:1. The true Apostles are those who live like Jesus Who said, 'I came to the world to give testimony to the Truth' (John 18:37);2. They are those who live according to the divine will, along the path of Our Lord Who said, 'I came down from heaven,\\n\\n\\nnot to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me' (John 6:38). 'As the servants of Christ, they do the will of God from the heart' (Eph. 6:6).3. They will have the gift of working miracles, as to make the blind to see, the lame to walk, the lepers to be cured, the deaf to hear and the dead to be revived back to life (Matt. 11:5), which were the signs given to St. John the Baptist by Our Lord Jesus Christ; or they will have their faith.'Jesus of Nazareth was approved of God among you, by miracles and wonders and signs' (Acts. 2:22).According to the words of St. Paul: 'The signs of my (true) Apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds' (2 Cor. 12:12), he who will have the miraculous power to restore sight to the blind by birth, to make the lame by birth to walk, to make the dumb by birth to speak and to raise the dead to life, or he who have their faith of such people and preach it, can be a true Apostle.Saints such as St. Antony of Padua, St. Xavier, St. Dominic, St. Ambrose, St. Vincent Ferrer and so on, proved that they were true aposles, that their Faith was true and that they had received the gifts of the Spirit of Truth by working countless miracles; Saints like St. Xavier, St. Antony, St. Pope Pius V, and the female saints such as St. Bernadetteand St. Catherine of Siena, by their incorruptible bodies (See the Biographies of Saints.), and St. Francis of Assisi and St. Pio by their stigmata. This gift of stigmata, being only in the Catholic Church, bears a strong testimony to the Catholic Church, being the only true Church, founded by Christ Himself and having the true Apostles. Can anyone who belongs to any Protestant sect prove that he has the same miraculous power? Never! And the apostles of these sects are also false ones! Their sects are also false ones! Therefore, let us slight these false ones!5. A true Apostle must have been really sent by Our Lord Himself.'I send you, as My Father sent Me' (John 20:21) said Our Lord. He also sent them giving the authority saying, 'Feed My lambs, take care of My sheep' (John 21:15-17). St. Paul admonishes to 'stand fast and hold the traditions which you have learnt' (2 Thess.2:15). But if some new people, not known to Christ suddenly came to show themselves up saying that Jesus Himself sent them also, after centuries, after1500 years of Our Lord, not descending from those who were authorized by Christ and not standing fast, nor holding the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lord Himself, is it not a lie and a deception? Who sent these after 1500 years? The biographies of those who\\n\\nnot die' (Gen. 3:4) and 'You will become like God and know good and bad if you eat this fruit' (Gen. 3:5), thus telling them half truth (Gen. 3:22) and making them subject to hell which is the second death (Apoc. 20:14; 21:8). Even nowadays he has risen false people to deceive the children of God. They carry a Bible and utter the Names of Jesus, the Holy Ghost and Jehovah in vain; they gather crowds saying they are powerful to heal the blind, deaf, dumb and lame by birth, even when they do not have the miraculous power to do greater things with true power of the True Spirit (John 16:12; 15:26) and by the Name of Jesus (John 14:2); though Our Lord or the Apostles never blabbered saying the word `spirit' again and again, they do so; though Our Lord and the Apostles never called anyone to testify, they voluntarily call people to bear testimony to their acts; they commit atrocities making money in the name of service: are all these right before God? They each teach their own doctrine, but try to establish that what they all say is true, thus preach truth mixed with falsehood. As troubling the waters and fishing, they lay their snare in the name of faith, and the devil drags men who fall into them, into hell which is his eternal abode. I beg you to realize this and refrain from these messengers of the devil! Flee from those who fish men by becoming the messengers of the devil through the sects made by man, in order not to become subject to the curse of our Lord: 'Depart from Me,established these 'churches' are enough to testify that they were none but less than ordinary people! Moreover, they are liars who say they are apostles, but in truth, they are not (Apoc. 2:2). Therefore it must be Satan, the father of lies (John 8:44) who sent them to pretend like apostles (2 Cor. 11:13). Otherwise, it would not be possible for each of them to teach a separate and new doctrine and establish obstinately that what they teach is the truth! Realize that 'There is one Faith and one Baptism' (Eph. 4:5)! Has falsehood swollen everywhere to the extent that they could not even understand that if a person's teaching is true, then that of the others different from the first one must be false? Have they lost their mind and intellect? But there is nothing to wonder seeing that they, knowing not the difference between Truth and falsehood, are damned. It is because they are the children of the Liar and the accomplices of Satan, the spirit of falsehood. Even after Paul said that the sabbaths are a shadow of things to come (Col. 2:16,17), it is comical that they formed a Seventh Day Adventist church in its name!Those who deceive will be deceived in the end!In the beginning, Satan the Liar (Apoc. 12:9; John 8:44) deceived our first parents by appearing like a serpent hiding his own hideous figure and saying, 'Indeed you will\\nyou cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matt. 25:41)!\"},{\"question\":\"11. Is not irresolute faith false?\",\"id\":11,\"value\":\"Will our Lord be in the midst of those who assemble in His Name, but against His will (Matt. 19:20)? Not at all, won't He? Once I approached a preacher who gathers people and convenes meetings and asked what the purpose of such meetings was? He answered that he has been anointed in the spirit, that he had received the gift of the word of wisdom and the gift of diverse tongues and that he had been redeemed. (Gift of word of wisdom in Tamil is Para(n)vasa Paechu varam). He could not give correct explanations to my questions such as what Paran+vasam is, what things would become Paran (God) vasam (belong to), what the condition of a man when he reaches the state of ecstasy would be, etc.To say, 'I have the gift of diverse tongues':Question: Do you speak multiple tongues? What languages have you spoken heretofore? Answer: I don't know. Question: Do you know at least what you say when you speak multiple tongues? Answer: I don't know. 'If so, how can you say that you speak diverse tongues? Please speak an alien language. I will record it in a tape. I give you onemonth's time. Can you prove that this is this language?' I threw the gauntlet in his court. He could not prove it till date!Is it right to say, 'I have been redeemed'?Have you been redeemed? He said yes. I asked the right meaning to the word redemption as per the Holy Bible. He wouldn't know. I then asked whether a person could call himself as `redeemed' even when he is in the state of sin. He said no. 'Is not each of the vain words a sin according to the words of Jesus: 'Every idle word men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment' (Matt. 12:36)? Have you never spoken idle words?' Answer: 'May be!' 'If so, how could say that you were redeemed in the past tense, while you have done the sin of speaking idle words?' He immediately answered, 'I am redeemed, I will be redeemed!' Then I said to him, 'You can say that you were redeemed when you would be saved in the end of our life.' Even St. Paul says, 'I cannot say that I had already attained (redemption) or were already perfect' (Phil. 3;12). Moreover, Jesus will redeem in the end when He will show Himself again. 'The second time He will appear to them who, without sin, expect Him unto salvation' (Heb.9:28). Let us understand the words, 'They promise them liberty, whereas they themselves are the slaves of corruption' (2 Peter 2:19).\\nthe inordinate number of diverse sects in the world, established and willed by God. Newman, Chesterton, Nax, Brownsen, Mariten, Mann, Govennerton, Muckeridge, Paul Wetcomb, who previous belonged to other `churches' came to understand the falsehood of their sects and entered in the Roman Catholic Church. Likewise let them who are now in the schismatic sects come forward honestly to find the Truth, the True Church! May they undertstand that the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, which has been existing since the time of Apostles, is the true Church! May they join with courage of heart in it and find redemption in it!Is it right to go after perdition through schism?As per the words, 'Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand'(Matt. 12:25), while Our Lord established His only Church, was it right for Martin Luther to have resisted it after many centuries, that is, in 1517 AD, and established his own sect under the name, 'the Lutheran church'? If what he did was right, everybody must have followed him and be in his sect now. Mustn't they? On the contrary, those who were at first in his sect, they came out to establish their own, multiple sects! Was Henry VIII, monarch of England, aIn which 'church' are you now?I asked that preacher, 'By birth, what `church' did you belong to?' 'The Church of South India' he said. Then he entered the Pentecostal Mission, afterwards, 'Gospel Pentecostal Mission. He said that he was in the Full Gospel Pentecostal Mission by then. I asked him, 'You were saying that the Church of South India was the true church, when you were in it, weren't you?' 'Yes!' 'Now being enrolled in the Pentecostal Mission, you say that this is the true church and C.S.I. has become a false one to you. Hasn't it?' 'Yes' again! 'Is this right to say that the sect in which one is for the time being is the true one and the previous one was false? Then, which one, do you think, is the real true church?' There was no answer from him. Let us at least try to find the right answer.Was there anyone who sought and found out the right, True Church?One should not be content with the `church' in which he is. He should find whether it is the true one, whether it acts according to the will of God and then join the true Church which moves in the right way.So many were the great people who analysed which Church was the true Church of redemption among\\n\\n\\nproper and honest founder of 'a church', who rose against the Pope who refused him permission to marry a girl named 'Ann Polin', when his first wife was still alive, created the Anglican church and began to preach heresy against the Church in 1534 AD? Or was not the praiseworthy and holy Pope Leo XIII, who was ready to lose a country from the Church, in order to abide by the words of Our Lord, 'What God has joined together, let no man put asunder' (Matt. 19:6), excommunicated king Henry VIII from the Church on the18th of September 1986, refusing permission to his wish for a divorce from his first wife, thus saving the Truth, a perfect head of the Church? Think of it! The Church did not expire. But it is the schismatic churches which face divisions day by day and are scattered and destroyed.Around 1550 AD, John Calvin founded the Calvin church, in 1606, John Smith, the Baptist church, in 1739, John Wesley, the Methodist church, William Boodh, the Salvation Army in 1895 AD, and some other men, London Mission, the C.S.I., C.N.I., the Maranatha, the Bride's church etc. some centuries ago. And each of them claimed that his `church' was established by Christ Himself. Is it not clear that this statement is against truth and hence a sin against the Spirit of Truth (Matt. 12:32)? 'Cursed is he who believes man' (Jer. 17:5). Therefore let us depend upon the only, Roman, Catholic Church, established by God, the ChristHimself around 1970 years ago, not believing man and not joining the `churches' made by man. This is the only Church which exists since the time of Apostles till date! And let us realize this truth! If you look for truth outside this Truth, you will find only emptiness there!Is it right to accept the Pentecostal Mission?It has nowhere said in the Bible that men could establish any church or the Pentecostal church according to their own will; and there is no grounds in the Bible to believe that such a church existed.On account of the words, 'Do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God,' (1 John 4:1) there is no room for belief in them even if they say that the Spirit of God works in them only. They lack the power of Truth, of the Spirit to cure a blind man, or a dumb or a lame from birth, as the saints of the Roman Catholic Church had done with the power of the Spirit of Truth. 'There shall rise false Christs and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders, insomuch as to deceive (if possible) even the elect. Behold I have told it to you beforehand' (Matt.24:24,25). Therefore, beware of the deceivers who promise to cure you, with the power of the spirit of falsehood or, in some other deceitful ways!\\nIs it right to say that the Holy Ghost came on the Day of Pentecost. He has established the Pentecostal church on the very day and it is the true church?Did the Holy Ghost descended only on the day of Pentecost (Levi 23:16), meaning the 50th day? In view of His descent on the 50+50=100th day, a double Pentecostal day, on some heathen people (Acts. 10:44), are they going to create Double Pentecostal church? Even the present Pentecostal church, came to exist only after 1500 years after Christ, didn't they?Are they going to establish Pentecostal churches by the name of His descent on 70 people in the Old Testament during the period of Moses (Numbers 11:25), on Samson (Judges 14:6), on David (1 Samuel 16:13), on the Apostles when they were with our Lord Jesus, with Whose power they preached, worked miracles and baptized (Matt. 10:8; Mark 6:13; Luke 10:17), thus preparing the Church, and also for His descent according to the words of Our Lord: 'It is the Spirit of your Fathers, Who speaks from within you' (Matt. 10:20)? Find that even at the time of Our Lord in this world, the Church was in action under His leadership!The History of the establishment of the Church in Rome according to the Will of God.Other than the Roman Catholic (Catholic=universal) Church which has been spread throughout the world according to the words of Our Lord, 'Go into the whole world and preach the Gospel to every creature' (Mark 16:15), all the other churches are against the will of God and against the Bible!Our Lord Jesus Christ has established only one Church (Matt. 16:18) and has arranged that it be one flock under one Shepherd (John 10:16), be one (John 17:20,21), be indestructible and infallible (Matt. 16:19; Luke 22:32; Acts. 5:38,39) and be guided under the leadership of Simon Peter (Matt. 10:2) who is the prince of the Apostles (John 21:15-17). And St. Peter also preached with infallibility and has admonished to 'understand first that no prophecy of Scripture is made by private interpretation' (2 Pet. 1:20). Then, will it be the divine will to found so many new schismatic sects day after day, preach as one's own mind leads him to, and interpret as one wishes, against the above words of St. Peter? No! Moreover, it is rather true that this is against God and the Bible!\\nAs it was said in the Bible that the Roman Catholic Church would be founded in Rome, in the words of Daniel, 'In the days of those kingdoms, the God of Heaven will establish a Kingdom' (Dan.2:44; 7:27), St. Peter came to Rome in 42 AD and established the Church there (See the History of the Church, page 20). After being in Rome and having led the Church, for the last 25 years of his life, he was martyred, crucified upside down by the Roman Government on the mountain called Janiculum on the 29th of June, 67 AD. (Ibidem, p.36). It is on his tomb that the Largest Christian church in the world, the Basilica of St. Peter, was built. Therefore, Realize it well that the prophecy that the Kingdom of God which is the Catholic Church would be founded in Rome (Col. 1:13; Dan. 7:27) was fulfilled!Moreover, as per the prophecy that the Church would suffer a lot in Rome (Dan. 7:26), it had been in distress. Then according to the prophecy that it would gain the right to rule from there, Emperor Constantine, son of St. Helena, won the battle by the sign of the Cross, shown to him on the horizon and gave the Church full freedom through the monarchical Treaty of Milan. Since then, the Church has been spreading throughout the world with full freedomaccording to the will of God having Rome as its Head quarters. All the Christians of the world had accepted the leadership of Rome since that time. It is right to be one accepting this leadership. And it would be wrong to oppose it. Everyone must perceive this truth!The Roman Pontiffs are none other than the Successors of St. Peter!St. Peter, the head of the Church elected Mathias in stead of Judas (Acts. 1:26) by lots (Prov. 16;33). And Mathias was also accepted by the Church. Similarly St. Lenus (2 Tim. 4:21; Duration of pontificate 67-76 AD), St. Cletus (76-88 AD), St. Clement and then other popes (Pope = Father, 1 Tim. 5:1) were elected by lots as time went on. Many of them shed their blood for Christ and bore testimony to their Lord. Until the first printing machine was invented by John Guttenberg in 1455 AD, they made the religious in the monasteries obliged to copy and prepare manuscripts of the Bible day and night. Now imagine whether it is right to slander calling them antichrists, who thus gave their life, and who gave us the feast of Christmas etc. and the manuscriptural copies of the Bible? Will Antichrist give life for Christ? Will he give us Bible and feasts such as Christmas? If God had not given to the popes, the successors of St. Peter the infallibility, can have they led\\n\\nthe Church as a unified body? Can they show us the true Way for redemption? Those who call the popes as antichrists, who have been saving the Church from destruction, ruling and leading it since then, when other schismatic sects were split again and again and went in the path of destruction, have they accepted the Bible codefied by the Antichrist? Or, are they celebrating Christmas which was given by Antichrist?Those who oppose the Pope who is the Vicar of Christ and the Successor of St. Peter, are the real false christs (1 John 4:3). They are the antichrists! They are those who put themselves into destruction by founding a number of schismatic sects (Matt. 12:25).Is it right to say that we could be redeemed if we live according to our conscience?St. Paul says, 'My conscience does not blame me in anything. Yet, I am not hereby justified, but He Who judges me, is the Lord' (1 Cor. 4:4); for the conscience is inconstant and can become blunt. For instance, our conscience shows something as good at one time. But if we happen suffer from some difficulty or loss because of it, then we think that it was not good to have engaged ourselves in it. This is natural!When a man shows something as good andanother as bad, how can we judge who is right? One person praises God for creating such a beautiful rose even in a thorny bush, whereas another blames Him to have created this beautiful flower in such a thorny bush. Who is right?!The same people who called St. Paul a murderer, called him a god after some time at the same place (Acts. 28:4-6). However in reality, he was neither a murderer nor a god. So both these statements were wrong. From this, we can understand that we are obliged to fulfill the holy will of God Who is constant and unchangeable, not believing our own consciences which change every moment.Is every religion good?Ask those who say that all religions are good and one can be redeemed, though he is in any religion or sect, 'There is salvation in my religion or the sect, so are you ready to join in it?' Will his mind consent for this? It it consents, he will not be a liar. Instead, if he doesn't, he deceives you, having something in his mind, and showing another in his speech or conduct. He reveals through his conduct that nothing is same. Therefore, let us be in the Roman Catholic Church which is the only Church for salvation.\\n\"},{\"question\":\"12.

That is why our Lord asks: 'What does it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and suffers the loss of his own soul? Or what exchange will a man give for his soul?' (Matt. 16:26). Will you be thickheaded enough to enslave your soul to sin and ready to live with the devil inthe everlasting fire of hell?Does hell exist?Nowadays many say: 'There is neither hell nor heaven; The happy life in this world is the only heaven, and the suffering life is the only hell.' Some others blabber knowingly or unknowingly: 'There may be heaven; but no hell; hell is a only a stage, not a place of horrible chastisements.'If we discern their life carefully, one thing will become evident to us: their sinful life. Their silly desire to live as they wish, as if there were no hell, so that they could sin without obstruction or fear, makes them dare to speak against the eternal truth.God is full of love; will such a God give such a horrible punishment of hell to men, they ask. God is not only full of love, but He is the figure and abode of eternal goodness. But the same God of love and goodness is also the Lord of Justice and it can never be on the contrary! And it is absolutely necessary too! Can anyone prove that He is unjust? It is only lawful and just that this God, Who is the Judge of the universe, must punish the guilty ones, the sinners, when He judges all the people. To deny this will be only unjust!If a person slams his father on his cheek, we call it a crime, we punish it or condemn it. If the same strike was given to an officer or a king, the atrocity of punishment naturally increases according to the status of the person hit, though the strike is the same! Likewise, if God is struck like this, it would be a terrible sin! God has created us, supports and nourishes us, and has given us commandments for our good life. If we kick them and deny them with hands, it would be equivalent to kicking God Himself and slamming Him on His cheeks. Such an atrocious act can only be punished with the horrid hellish punishment. And it would also be just and worthy in every way. If you say this is unjust, you raise yourself as a judge above God!

St. Theresa the great also saw hell. Rev. Sister Josepha Menendez was dragged to the depths of the earth, into the hell many times in 1922 by the devils (See: Anbin Azhaippu-p.276-282, The way of Divine Love). There must be a place where the devils live! It must be hell! When some saints exorcised the devils, they fled into the bowels of earth and hid themselves!The wise Doctors of the Church, like St. Thomas Aquinas who was called an angelic doctor and who was praised by Our Lord Himself, also have confirmed the existence of hell. Can those who deny this, prove that they are more wise that these great doctors?everything?Moreover, if you say hell is just a stage, tell me whether that stage is in this world? Are the world and hell the same? No. This earthly word is one thing and hell is another. There is west against east. There is a top against the bottom. And there is a reward and a punishment as well! And there are numerous Scriptural proofs for this! (Job. 20:26; Isai. 5:14; Jer. 15:14; Ezek. 15:6-7; Matt. 3:10, 12, 5:22, 29... Mark 9:42,43; Luke 3:9; 12:5; John 15:16; 2 Peter 3:7; Apoc. 17:16; 19:20; 20:9; 21:8, etc.)When mentioning hell, our Lord said, 'If your right eye scandalizes you, pluck it from you, for it is expedient for you that one of your members should perish, rather than that your whole body go into hell' (Matt. 5:29). He also says that the rich man was in agony in the fire of hell (Luke 17:24). Moreover He will say to the sinners, '...go into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels' (Matt. 25:41), and cast them into hell! Is Our Lord a liar who spoke unnecessarily about a hell that does not exist? Do they know more than Him? Is hell, which is a sea of fire and brimstone and which is the second death (Apoc: 20:14; 21:8) in this world? No. But it is said to be at the core of this earth.\\nScientific Proofs for the existence of Hell:Even the scientist say that the core of the earth has a temperature above 2000oC.The terrific lava itself erupting from the mouths of the vulcanoes proves that the centre of the earth is fiery and it confirms the existence of hell! Similarly, it is clearly conceivable that the abode of God, the angels and saints must also be somewhere.A group of geologists who engaged themselves in the research of inside of the earth in the region of Siberia of Russia, dug a hole 14 km deep, suddenly the powerful bit of the drill began to spin at a much higher spped. Dr. Azzacov, the manager of the team reports that there was an empty space below, the temperature recorded was above 2000oC. He also confirmed that they heard painful cries of lamentations of millions of human voices and recorded them in their devices (See Rethctions From the Franciscan Minims, March-April, 1990 issue).Death may come at an unexpected time (Matt. 24:44). Devastating wars or natural calamities may arise all of a sudden. Therefore, let us not give a chance to anyone to drag us into hell in the end, by convincing us that there is no hell, thus removing the fear of sin from us! Let us whowalk as if on hell, be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48) in order not to be led astray and fall into sin and thereby into the horrible hell.Money or Character?No matter whether we are rich or poor, we will have to pass away from this world in around 100 years or 150 years at the most. Don't we have to spare at least two hours a day in the 24 hours a day given to us by Our Lord? Where our treasure is, there will our hearts be! Do we remember everyday our eternal happiness in heaven which is our eternal treasure? (Matt. 6:21). If we truly seek first the kingdom of God and His justice, all we need for our temporal life will be given to us by our Lord. It is also our duty to look for the Holy Sacraments ardently. Let us do to the others, whatever we want others to do to us (Matt. 7:12)!Of course money is necessary for our temporal life. Similarly, water is necessary to make a voyage by ship. But that ship will be safe until the water is outside the ship. If it seeps in, it becomes a danger to the ship itself. Just like that, money should be kept outside our mind to a necessary extent. If a passion for money enters inside us, we will find ourselves buying hell (Mark 14:21), yearning for thirty pieces of silver like Judas (Matt. 26:15). Or we will be like the rich\\nman who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day and in the end, was cast into hell (Luke 16:19-23). 'To whomsoever much is given, of him much shall be required' (Luke 12:48). Let us make the poor like Lazarus with the wealth of iniquity (Luke 16:9). Let us enter into the Kingdom of Heaven by helping the little brothers of Christ our Lord (Matt.25:40).How can we get everything we aspire?There can be no one who has got all the money, all the education and all the positions he longs for, together. Therefore, let us strip off from ourselves all the excessive desires and let us long for things at a right extent! If we possess Our Lord Who has everything in perfection, we will possess everything!Guard your five senses!How will it be if we act in a foolish way saying that the eyes are for seeing anything, ears are for hearing anything and mouth is for speaking anything or for consuming anything including wine and using all the five senses as we desire? If we go out of station keeping the door open with lakhs of money inside, thinking that the door is for going in and out, won't we be the fool who invites the thief to steal all his money? If in this way, we keep our five senses open to radio, T.V., cinema, gossipping, drunkenness and adulteryetc. without temperance, then Satan will happily enter into the house of our heart through evil shows, evil speech, and evil conduct, steal our precious soul and take it with him into the everlasting fire of hell. It is good for us to be vigilant in this regard. Therefore, it will be expedient for us to realize that 'He who is faithful in least things, is faithful in greater things also. He who is unjust in least things, is unjust also in greater things' (Luke 16:10), and be faithful to the Lord even in trivial matters. To fulfill the duties of our state of life everyday without fail and carefully is essential for a peaceful life, our good life.Silence is necessary!It would be prudent for us to refrain from noises and dins, if we would like to see God and to listen to the soft voice of God. It would be perfect if we establish calmness in our soul. It is wise to keep silence so that the acts of graces should not be obstructed. Let us understand why Our Lord went on searching for calm and silent places to pray!Is prayer and penance necessary?Prayer and penance are our two wings which let us fly towards God. Therefore prayer and penance are absolutely necessary for us. Keeping temperance in eating helps us to control our body. It is utmost necessary to obtain our\\nspiritual food which is the grace of our Lord. Those who avoid prayer and penance hardly reach God. Prayer is victory. He who knows how to pray knows how to survive. Pious prayer never fails to yield fruit.Blessed are the pure of heart!It is easy for those who are pure of heart to attain God. We should never forget that if we do not pray and do penance, if we do not avoid too much familiarity with the opposite sex, if we do not seek the embrace of Our Blessed Mother, full of grace, Who embraces Her little children, we will never be able to persist in chastity. The unruly state of the motherless and lavishing son should never come to us. If we stretch our hands towards the worldly pleasures, our clutch on God Who is Love, will become limpered and we will lose contact. Our souls will be exposed to the greatest danger. We may loose the eternal Beatitude. Therefore, let us grasp with filial love, our Father's hands Who bears us, and walk along His path!Is intoxication of wine necessary?'Wine is a luxurious thing, and drunkenness riotous: whosoever is delighted therewith shall not be wise (Prov. 20:1). 'Take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and thecares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly, for it will come upon all who sit upon the fact of the whole earth as a snare' (Luke 21:34; Isai. 65:4). So, let us strip off from ourselves, drunkenness which enslaves us and our families, and lead us to perdition! Let us realize that nothing is impossible to Our Lord and ask the favor of His grace!Service to God, or self?We are all incumbent to labor for God and the salvation of souls! It will be good for us to read the Scriptures at least 15 minutes a day. It will also be profitable to spare some time to teach the Catholic Truths to others. We must not be only the readers of the Bible, but also the followers of it. If those who engage themselves to the service of God take too much care of their own comfort and pleasures, they will become the servants of their own selves. It was the great saints such as St. Francis Xavier, who converted many, served God in an exemplary way and obtained for themselves an incorruptible body and a good popularity.Truth, Love and the Will of God are the Foundations of Salvation!The world is moving along a path of destruction through thousands of homicides, theft, adultery, killing of unborn babies through abortion, bribery, fraudulence, etc. every\\nsecond throughout the world. Let us be truthworthy in everything to save this world. Let us practise the first two commandments of love. It is not enough for us to say that we have Faith, Hope and Love. Let us ask ourselves whether we really have the divine Faith, Hope and divine Love. Let us learn from God made Man humility and meekness. And through these let us obtain the eternal rest (Matt. 11:29).Lack of true love is indeed the foundation of all the sins! Therefore, in atonement for this, let us try to say frequently the act of Love, 'Jesus and Mary, I love you; save the souls' when we go, when we come and when we work! And through this practice, we can save a number of souls!Sin entered into this world because of the infringement of the Will of God. Therefore, only to make penance for this, Our Lord Jesus Christ said, 'I came down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him Who sent Me' (John 6:38); 'Not as I will, but as You will' (Matt. 26:39). And He calls brothers and sisters who do the Holy Will of God (Matt. 12:50). It will be they who will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, He says (Matt. 7:21).Therefore let us pray before commencing anything, check whether it is the will of God, and if we are convincedthat it is so, let us do it without the least deviation (James 4:15). Every now and then, pray, saying, 'Dear Father, make me worthy to do Your Will, for I belong to you entirely' and consequently obtain the divine favors, walk along the 'path of redeeming Truth and be redeemed!
